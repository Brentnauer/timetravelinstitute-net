**TimeTravelInstitute.net** is the **archive and research arm** of the [Time Travel Institute](https://timetravelinstitute.com).  
Where the `.com` domain hosts the living community, `.net` provides a curated, structured reference library.

---

## Overview

The site brings together three pillars of long-term preservation and discovery:

- **John Titor Archives**  
  The definitive collection of original materials — forum posts, IRC logs, and media appearances — preserved and made available as downloadable PDFs.

- **Time Travel Media Library**  
  A catalog of books, films, TV, games, and other works involving time travel, organized by common tropes and metadata for research and exploration.

- **TTI Hall of Fame**  
  A showcase of the most interesting community threads and claims, curated and surfaced beyond the flow of the forums.

---

## Technology

- **Design**: Webflow, exported via **DevLink**  
- **Framework**: Next.js  
- **CMS**: Headless WordPress  
- **Identity**: Discourse SSO (`timetravelinstitute.com`)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel

---

## Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally **ad-hoc and evolving** — priorities may shift as the archive grows:

- [ ] John Titor Archives (core posts, annotated, with downloadable PDF exports)  
- [ ] Library Phase 1 — MVP browsing experience with seeded dataset  
- [ ] Library Phase 2 — SSO and community submissions  
- [ ] Library Phase 3 — user ratings, filters, and discovery tools  
- [ ] Hall of Fame system for highlighting notable threads and claims
